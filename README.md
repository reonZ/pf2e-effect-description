# FoundryVTT PF2e Effect Description

![](./readme/tooltip.webp)

This module simply adds additional clicking options for the `Effects Panel` (top right of the screen):

-   `[Shift + Right Click]` will remove the effect entirely (skipping all the counters if any). You can also use `[Ctrl + Right Click]` (because of firefox limitation) though it won't be displayed in the effect tooltip.

-   `[Ctrl + Left Click]` will open the effect sheet, where the description and other options are available.

# Settings

Users can enable each option individually in the settings.
